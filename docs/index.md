# Jaculus - JavaScript runtime for embedded devices

Jaculus allows for running JavaScript code on embedded devices.

Currently supports ESP32 and ESP32-S3 SoCs ([Github](https://github.com/cubicap/Jaculus-esp32)). Core functionality of the device is provided by the [Jaculus-dcore](https://github.com/cubicap/Jaculus-dcore) library, which can be used to port Jaculus to other platforms.

For implementing the runtime environment and communication interface, the [Jaculus-machine](https://machine.jaculus.org) and [Jaculus-link](https://link.jaculus.org) libraries are used, and their documentation can be found on their respective pages.
