# Jaculus - JavaScript runtime for embedded devices

Jaculus allows you to run JavaScript code on embedded platforms.

Currently supports ESP32 and ESP32-S3 SoCs ([Github](https://github.com/cubicap/Jaculus-esp32)).

Core functionality for porting to other platforms is provided by
[Jaculus-dcore](https://github.com/cubicap/Jaculus-dcore) library.
